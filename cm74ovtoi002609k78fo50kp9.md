When working with Ruby on Rails, understanding how to share functionality between classes is essential. Two key tools for achieving this are `include` and `extend`, which allow you to incorporate methods from modules into your classes. Although they may seem similar, they serve distinct purposes.

## What is `include`?

The `include` keyword is used to add methods from a module as **instance methods** to a class. This means objects created from the class can access these methods.

### Example of `include`:

```ruby
module Greetable
  def greet
    "Hello from an instance!"
  end
end

class User
  include Greetable
end

user = User.new
puts user.greet  # Output: "Hello from an instance!"
```

In this example, `greet` becomes an instance method accessible from the `User` object.

---

## What is `extend`?

The `extend` keyword adds methods from a module as **class methods** to a class. As a result, the class itself can call these methods.

### Example of `extend`:

```ruby
module Greetable
  def greet
    "Hello from the class!"
  end
end

class User
  extend Greetable
end

puts User.greet  # Output: "Hello from the class!"
```

In this case, `greet` becomes a class method accessible directly from the `User` class.

## Combining `include` and `extend`

Sometimes, you may want both class-level and instance-level methods from the same module. You can achieve this by using `self.included` to extend the class when it includes the module.

### Example of `include` with `extend`:

```ruby
module Greetable
  def self.included(base)
    base.extend(ClassMethods)
  end

  module ClassMethods
    def class_greet
      "Hello from class method!"
    end
  end

  def instance_greet
    "Hello from instance method!"
  end
end

class User
  include Greetable
end

user = User.new
puts user.instance_greet   # Output: "Hello from instance method!"
puts User.class_greet      # Output: "Hello from class method!"
```

This approach allows the module to define both class-level and instance-level behaviors.

## Key Differences Between `include` and `extend`

| Aspect | `include` (Instance Methods) | `extend` (Class Methods) |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Scope | Adds methods to instances of the class. | Adds methods directly to the class. |
| Usage | `include ModuleName` | `extend ModuleName` |
| Accessibility | Called on instances (`object.method`) | Called on class (`Class.method`) |

## Conclusion

Understanding the difference between `include` and `extend` is crucial for writing clean, modular, and reusable code in Ruby on Rails applications. Use `include` for instance methods, `extend` for class methods, and combine them when you need both. Mastering these patterns will make your Rails applications more organized and efficient.
