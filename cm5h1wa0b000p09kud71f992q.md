Utilizing `jsonapi_deserialize(params)` followed by converting it to an `OpenStruct` enables you to access the deserialized parameters as methods on the resulting object.

```ruby
require 'ostruct'

# Assuming jsonapi_deserialize(params) returns a hash
params_hash = { "email" => "kumar@outlook.com", "password" => "Test@123" }

# Converting the hash into an OpenStruct
deserialized_params = OpenStruct.new(params_hash)

# Accessing values using method syntax
puts deserialized_params.email    # Output: kumar@outlook.com
puts deserialized_params.password # Output: Test@123
```

### Explanation:

1. `jsonapi_deserialize(params)`: This function generally parses a JSON:API-compliant request payload into a standard Ruby hash.
    
2. [`OpenStruct.new`](http://OpenStruct.new)`(hash)`: Converts the provided hash into an `OpenStruct` object, allowing the keys to be accessed as methods.
    
3. Usage: You can now access the hash values as though they were attributes of a class instance (`deserialized_params.email`).
