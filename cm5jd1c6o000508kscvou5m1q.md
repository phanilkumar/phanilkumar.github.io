Discover the power of Rails' Action View Form Helpers in this comprehensive guide. Learn how to effectively use `form_with` to enhance security and streamline form creation in your web applications. Perfect for developers looking to master Rails form handling.

**Introduction:**

The main form helper in Rails, `form_with`, is a powerful tool for creating forms in your web applications. When invoked without arguments, it generates an HTML `<form>` tag with the `method` attribute set to `post` and the `action` attribute pointing to the current page. For instance, if you're on the home page at `/home`, the resulting HTML will reflect this setup. An important feature of this form is the inclusion of a hidden `input` element for the `authenticity_token`. This token is crucial for non-GET form submissions as it serves as a security measure against cross-site request forgery (CSRF) attacks. Rails form helpers automatically include this token for every non-GET form, provided the security feature is enabled.

```ruby
<%= form_with do |form| %>
  Form contents
<% end %>
```

```ruby
<form action="/home" accept-charset="UTF-8" method="post">
  <input type="hidden" name="authenticity_token" value="Lz6ILqUEs2CGdDa-oz38TqcqQORavGnbGkG0CQA8zc8peOps-K7sHgFSTPSkBx89pQxh3p5zPIkjoOTiA_UWbQ" autocomplete="off">
  Form contents
</form>
```
