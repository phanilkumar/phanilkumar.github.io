When working with Git, there are times when you need to switch branches without committing your changes. Whether you're in the middle of a task or performing quick checks, Git provides an elegant solution with `git stash`. In this blog, weâ€™ll walk through a step-by-step guide to add uncommitted changes and switch to the `master` branch without committing.

## Understanding the Need to Switch Branches Without Committing

Imagine youâ€™re working on a feature branch and suddenly need to check something on the `master` branch. Committing incomplete work just to switch branches is not ideal. This is where `git stash` comes to the rescue, allowing you to temporarily store your changes and retrieve them later.

## Step-by-Step Guide

### 1\. Stage Your Changes (Optional)

Before stashing, you may want to stage your changes if they are currently untracked.

```bash
# Stage all changes (optional)
git add .
```

This command adds all modified and untracked files to the staging area. If you only want to stash tracked changes, you can skip this step.

### 2\. Stash Your Changes

`git stash` temporarily stores your work so you can switch branches without losing any changes.

```bash
# Stash the changes with a descriptive message
git stash push -m "Temporary changes"
```

The `-m` flag adds a message to your stash, making it easier to identify later.

### 3\. Switch to the Master Branch

Now that your changes are safely stashed, you can switch to the `master` branch.

```bash
# Switch to the master branch
git checkout master
```

### 4\. Apply the Stashed Changes

After switching to `master`, retrieve your changes with the `apply` command.

```bash
# Apply the most recent stash
git stash apply
```

This restores your changes without removing the stash from the stash list.

## Additional Commands for Better Control

### View All Stashes

If you have multiple stashes, you can view them with:

```bash
git stash list
```

This will display a list of all stashed changes along with their messages.

### Drop a Stash After Applying

By default, `git stash apply` retains the stash. If you donâ€™t need it anymore, you can manually remove it:

```bash
# Drop the most recent stash
git stash drop
```

### Apply a Specific Stash

If you have multiple stashes and want to apply a specific one, identify it from the stash list and run:

```bash
# Apply a stash by its name
git stash apply stash@{2}
```

Replace `stash@{2}` with the desired stash identifier.

## Key Insights and Best Practices

* **Stash selectively:** You can stash only specific files if needed.
    
* **Keep your stash organised:** Use descriptive messages to easily track stashed changes.
    
* **Avoid data loss:** Make sure to apply and drop stashes carefully, especially when juggling multiple stashes.
    

## Conclusion

`git stash` is a powerful tool that helps developers manage work-in-progress changes while switching branches seamlessly. By following the steps outlined above, you can efficiently switch to the `master` branch without committing changes and maintain a clean, organised workflow.

Happy coding! ðŸš€
