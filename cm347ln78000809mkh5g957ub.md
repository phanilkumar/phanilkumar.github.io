By default, an `InboundEmail` that has been processed will be incinerated after 30 days. The `InboundEmail` is considered as processed when its status changes to `delivered`, `failed`, or `bounced`.

The actual incineration is done via the [`IncinerationJob`](https://api.rubyonrails.org/v7.2.2/classes/ActionMailbox/IncinerationJob.html) that's scheduled to run after [`config.action_mailbox.incinerate_after`](https://guides.rubyonrails.org/configuring.html#config-action-mailbox-incinerate-after) time. This value is set to `30.days` by default, but you can change it in your production.rb configuration.

The intention with Action Mailbox processing is that as you process an email, you should extract all the data you need from the email and persist it into domain models in your application. The `InboundEmail` stays in the system for the configured time to allow for debugging and forensics and then will be deleted.
